          <p>Alex spends most of his time creating stuff in one form or another and loves discovering new music or getting lost in an Asimov novel. He works as a Designer at Andculture, a design agency in downtown Harrisburg. He likes it there because there’s a new challenge every day and he’s surrounded by super great people. Alex loves Ashley’s sense of humor, her generosity, and the fact that they can create art together. He can’t imagine not spending the rest of his life with this girl.</p>

          <p>Alex and Ashley's story goes all the way back to their first few years at college. They first met in a sculpture class, during Ashley's freshman year (Alex was a sophomore). Throughout the next few years, they would have a few more classes together and always enjoyed talking in class. It didn't take long for Ashley to take a strong liking to Alex, and she would always look forward to her classes with him. Alex had no idea she felt this way, but still enjoyed her company and their witty banter in class. The semesters would end, and they would go their separate ways.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the summer of 2012, they were spontaneously reunited at a movie night with some mutual friends. After that night, they talked nonstop. Later in the summer, they both happened to be in Cape May for family vacations, and met up. This was the first time they ever spent time together alone, and now consider it to be their unofficial first date. The summer ended, and Ashley moved back to Messiah (Alex lived with his family, a few minutes away from campus).</p>
          <p>Within a week, Alex asked Ashley out on a date to hibachi and a movie. After that, the two became inseparable. It was their senior year, and they had many art classes together so they enjoyed spending time working on projects while enjoying each other's company. After college, Ashley moved home for a few months while Alex moved to an apartment in Harrisburg. It didn't take long for Ashley follow suit, and get her her own apartment close by.</p>
          <p>They enjoyed walking around the city and exploring new restaurants and cafes together. In January of 2015, Alex decided to take a big step forward in the relationship and ask Ashley to marry him. Soon after, a flurry of wedding planning began, in preparation for a can't-miss event that will go down in history! </p>
          <p>Alex and Ashley can't wait for all their family and friends to join them on the best day of their lives as they become husband and wife.</p>
